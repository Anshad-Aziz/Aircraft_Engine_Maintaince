# Aircraft_Engine_Maintaince
develop a predictive maintenance model for aircraft engines. The primary objective is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of these engines based on sensor readings and operational parameters. Predictive maintenance is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing downtime, and ensuring the efficient operation of aircraft.
